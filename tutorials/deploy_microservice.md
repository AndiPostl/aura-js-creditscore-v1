# Part 1 - Deploy your first microservice

## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Deploy microservice version V1 with Istio enabled (using Wercker)
* Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)
* Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)

## Steps

### Deploy microservice version V1 with Istio enabled (using Wercker)

1. Set up the source code repo

We will use an existing application for this tutorial.

1.1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com)

1.2. Go to Sachin's GitHub repo [aura-js-creditscore](https://github.com/sachin-pikle/aura-js-creditscore) and fork it. You now have your own working copy of the repo version V1

2. Set up the Wercker CI/CD

2.1. Sign in to [Wercker](https://app.wercker.com)

2.2. Add application

2.3. Review the [wercker.yml](../wercker.yml) file

2.4. Set up the pipelines

Add images of each of the three pipelines

2.5. Set up the workflow

Add workflow image

3. Deploy the app using wercker CI/CD

3.1. Go to [V1 > view.ejs]()

3.2. Change title - add V1 

3.3. Commit the change

3.4. Wercker will fire the CI/CD workflow for V1. Check the progress on Wercker Pipelines > Runs.

3.5. Check Releases to confirm the new container image has been uploaded

3.6. Check the Kubernetes dashboard to see if the latest version got deployed. Takes ~35 seconds for K8s to terminate the old pods and start the new pod

3.7. Check the pod logs

### Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)

1. Access GET /api/creditscore in a browser and see the response
