# Part 1 - Deploy your first microservice

## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Deploy microservice version V1 with Istio enabled (using Wercker)
* Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)
* Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)

## Steps

### Deploy microservice version V1 with Istio enabled (using Wercker)

1. Set up the source code repo
	
	We will use an existing application for this tutorial.

	1.1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com)

	1.2. Go to Sachin's GitHub repo [aura-js-creditscore](https://github.com/sachin-pikle/aura-js-creditscore) and fork it. You now have your own working copy of the repo version V1

2. Set up the Wercker CI/CD

	2.1. Sign in to [Wercker](https://app.wercker.com)

	2.2. Add application

	2.3. Review the [wercker.yml](../wercker.yml) file

	2.4. Set up push-to-CR and deploy-to-CE pipelines
	
	**a) Pipeline: Create push-to-CR pipeline**

	**b) Pipeline: Create deploy-to-CE pipeline with environment variables**

	**c) List of all your pipelines:**

	2.5. Set up the workflow
	
	**a) Workflow: Add push-to-CR pipeline**

	**b) Workflow: Add deploy-to-CE pipeline**

	**c) List of all your workflows:**

3. Deploy the app using wercker CI/CD

	3.1. Edit [V1 > aura-js-creditscore/routes/creditscore.js](../routes/creditscore.js)

	3.2. Look for the following line and make the requested changes
	`// _CHANGE_ : Please comment the line with the DUMMY message and uncomment the one with the Welcome message`

	3.3. Commit the change

	3.4. Wercker will fire a workflow run for V1. Check the progress on Wercker Pipelines > Runs

	![Workflow run](images/ms-w-run-initial-msg-change.png)
	
	3.5. Check Releases to confirm the new container image has been uploaded

	![Releases Image Uploaded](images/ms-w-run-initial-cr-image-v1.png)
	
	3.6. Check the Kubernetes dashboard to see if the latest version got deployed. Note: When re-deploying it takes ~35 seconds for K8s to terminate the old pods and start the new pod

	![K8s Dashboard Shows Kubernetes Elements Created](images/ms-w-run-initial-k8s-dashboard.png)
	
	3.7. Check the pod logs

### Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)

1. Access GET /api/creditscore in a browser and you should see the following Welcome message

`{ "MESSAGE": "Welcome to aura-js-creditscore version V1" }`

2. (OPTIONAL) Access GET /api/creditscore in Postman and you should see the same Welcome message

`{
    "MESSAGE": "Welcome to aura-js-creditscore version V1"
}`
