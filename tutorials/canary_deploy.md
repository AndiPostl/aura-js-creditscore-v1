## Tutorial Flow

In this tutorial, we will go through the following flow:

* Deploy microservice version V2 with Istio enabled (using Wercker)
* Access GET "/api/creditscore" (in a Browser or in Postman)
* See the traffic distribution between versions V1 and V2
* Route 100% traffic to microservice version V2
* Observe the microservice behaviour (in Vizceral, Zipkin, Grafana)
