# Sample Microservices App - Aura JS Credit Score

## Introduction

This is a tutorial for microservices training. In this tutorial, we will cover the following features:

* Service Mesh - Deploy a microservice with Istio enabled
* Canary deployment - Switch traffic from version V1 to version V2
* Service Brokers - Provision and use a MongoDB instance
* API-first development
* CI/CD - Use Wercker to deploy our services


## About the sample application
 
This is a simple node.js microservices application that takes a bunch of parameters and returns a credit score. The application has the following interfaces:

1. REST API POST "/api/creditscore" - This takes input parameters (JSON) and returns the generated credit score (JSON)
2. REST API GET "/api/creditscore" - This only returns a hardcoded message for now
3. Front end UI accesible at "/" - This shows a simple form (UI) to capture the input parameters and to display the returned credit score

Note: In this tutorial, we will develop two versions of this service V1 and V2. 
* In version V1 we don't save any data
* In version V2 we use MongoDB to save/fetch data
 

In this tutorial 

* Deploy service 1 to Aura with ISTIO enabled
* Deploy service 2 v1 to Aura with ISTIO enabled
* Associate API descriptor with Service 2 K8s service
* Generate Javascript lib
* Add Javascript lib to service 1
* Update deployment for service 1
* Deploy service 2 v2
* Route traffic to service 2
* Distribute traffic
* Create MySQL broker
* Write code to connect service 2 to MySQL instance
* Update service 2 v2
